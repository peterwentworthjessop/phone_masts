# phone_masts
A benchmark test.

I have added 2 scripts.

phone_masts.py is the initial script for the test, that opens the csv file.
it will contain all of the functionality required for the test. 

test_phone_masts.py contains tests for the functionality developed so far.
It has been successfully run from the Windows 10 shell.

The folder phone_mast_data is where the csv file is kept, the folder must be copied to c:\phone_mast_data.
It also contains a csv file used by the test script.
